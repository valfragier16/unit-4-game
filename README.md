Instrructions:

What do you want to Create?
1. A crystal collector game where there are four crystals(displayed as buttons).

2. The player will be shown a random number at the start of the game. 

3. When the player clicks on a crystal, it will add a specific amount of points to the player's total score.

4. The player wins if their total score matches the random number from the beginning of the game.

5. The player losses if their score goes above the random number.

Loop:
The game restarts whenever the player wins or loses.
This will result in a score being displayed as a win or loss, and a new random number will be generated.


Points to remember:
Your game will hide this amount until the player clicks a crystal.
When they do click one, update the player's score counter.


The app should show the number of games the player wins and loses. To that end, do not refresh the page as a means to restart the game.


Game design notes:
The random number shown at the start of the game should be between 19 - 120.
Each crystal should have a random hidden value between 1 - 12.
